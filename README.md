# Quantitative Research and Statistical Experiment Design

This is a research based project done with R programming language. In this project, I have collected data on Air Quality Index for Bangalore, India. I used R programming language to process the raw data into structured tables. Once I have sorted the data, I have used different plotting libraries available in R to do data visualisations of the same.
